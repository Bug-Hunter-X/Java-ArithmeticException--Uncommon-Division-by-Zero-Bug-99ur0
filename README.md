# Java ArithmeticException Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon yet crucial error in Java: the `ArithmeticException` that arises from division by zero.  The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.java` presents a robust solution.  Understanding and handling these exceptions is critical for building reliable Java applications.  The exception occurs because integer division by zero is undefined. 

## How to Run

1. Save the files as `bug.java` and `bugSolution.java`.
2. Compile using a Java compiler: `javac bug.java` and `javac bugSolution.java`
3. Run: `java bug` and `java bugSolution` 

Observe the different outputs and exception handling.
